Summary of Your Project
Frontend: Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Backend: Node.js with Express for handling form submissions.

Database: form data is saved to a local formData.json file.

Dependencies: Managed via package.json (e.g., express, cors).

Local Hosting: You’re using a Node.js server (server.js) to serve the static files and handle form submissions.







1. Language
Since your backend is built with Node.js and Express, select:

Language: Node
2. Root Directory (Optional)
If all your project files are in the emotional-form folder and you don’t have additional subdirectories with unrelated code, you can leave this blank. Render will use the root directory by default.

If your project files are inside a subfolder (like src or similar), set the Root Directory to that folder.

For your setup:

Leave this blank unless your code is inside a subfolder.
3. Build Command
Since you’re using Node.js, you’ll likely need to install dependencies with npm install. If there’s no specific build step, the build command will simply install dependencies.

Build Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
4. Start Command
The Start Command should be the command that runs your app. Assuming you are using server.js as the entry point, the command will be:

Start Command:

bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
